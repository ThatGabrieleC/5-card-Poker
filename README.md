# 5 card Poker


This project has been created for a better understanding of some Python fundamentals in a basic/intermediate level.

I decided to make open the last part as open source mainly for two reason:  
1. **Curiosity:** I'm curious how other people would have faced the same challenge. Each point of view is unique and can lead to innovative solutions.
2. **Collaboration:** I firmly believe that collaboration can enrich our work and improve the overall project.

## üìåBefore all
It is important to stress that we want to maintain a friendly and collaborative environment. Diversity of opinion is one thing, but Aristotle's complex and lack of respect are another.

## üÉèStart playing!
As seen in demo, this program can be used directly in the console. 
There are three main sections while playing:
- **Start playing and changing cards:** The user can decide if he wants to keep his cards or change them by writing in the terminal the amount he wants(max is  five by writing all)
- **Comparing hands and score section:** Opponents hand will be seen by the user and there will be a compare between players hand, determining a winner and assgigning score to him/them.
- **Continue playing cycle:** at the end of every match the user can decide if he wants continue playing and if the deck should be shuffle or not. Every round will add to continue cycle 1 point; every 3 rounds the user can also decide to reset the score or maintain as it is.
